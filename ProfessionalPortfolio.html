                        <p>Hello my name is Chris but my friends call me Kiki. I currently work as a Director for a foster care company called Ensign Peak Services. I enjoy playing music and enjoy producing. Although I have been playing in bands for most
                            of my life I have taken a step back as I have gotten older and now only make beats and hiphop music. My DJ/Production moniker is CHIEF EDIT. My general opinion on life is to live and let live. I have strong leadership skills
                            and have been leading in my field for several years. I enjoy being creative and feel this is a good quality to have in a field of creation. I feel I have a good visual eye for design and placement. I was rased to believe that
                            everyone is created equal and feel everyone should have a chance to prove themselves. I think it is good to question everything and when you are able to ask question that lead to good answers it will then strengthens the solution
                            and create stability. I would enjoy working in an invironment that is able to question the status que and push for a new and unique ways of interpreting our world.</p>
